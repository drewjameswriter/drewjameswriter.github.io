        <h1>In The Lobby</h1>
      

<main>
    <p>The Nord Haus Apartments were akin to a cherry on top of a milkshake, a luxury high-rise living space with an interior set for a movie. Long, flat, and deep couches ran the east and west walls, inviting you into their sea-grey cushions that harbored bushels of white square pillows.  The north wall was a giant set of windows that stretched three stories high letting the sun shine on a carton of egg chairs fixed perfectly before one of the room’s two massive art installations.
 The first installation, a set of hanging wire beams that were clustered and lacking any uniform of length, was designed by the owner’s daughter and were to be seen as implication of “Strength”. The second installation, as if made from the scales of some great dream fish, was a gigantic shimmering sheet of shifting purple and green sequenced hues. It hung from top to bottom along the East wall as it wrapped around an extravagant staircase that brought you all the way to the third-floor community lobby. </p>
<p>To the West of the wires hung three wicker swinging chairs that would normally sit empty until the late evening when the rich drunks would amble out of their homes to wait for their Ubers and delivery treats. And finally, to the West of those swings, sitting in front of the lobby doors, sat the concierge desk, where Patrick Waterman spent most of his time. </p>
<p>It was 2:50 pm, just ten minutes before the end of what should have been a regular Wednesday, however Patrick Waterman’s long face said otherwise. He removed his glasses and let his lazy eye roll away from his nose and to the right as he pinched his eye bridge. He tried to exhale his thoughts, but his mind wouldn’t allow it. Why must this new age employee not work for works sake! He thought. Do they not feel the satisfaction of having a job? It’s undeniable! Our minds place a premium on discipline and a job is the golden elixir!
 Patrick had been a manager for over ten years in an industry that was older than America. He saw the practice of hospitality as a staple of good culture. Patrick believed a good service worker was to be empathetic and caring as well as enchanting; a sort of malleable water that can appear as nothing while saving the day. The responsibility of molding luxury atmospheres, he reasoned, was payment enough. </p>
<p>He put his glasses back on and reached into the drawer where he kept the notebook he had labeled: “A Manager’s Notes”.  He started thumbing through the black notebook that held compilations of quotes, tips, and bits of advice that Patrick thought every manager should have for when the going gets tough. It was his job to make sure that everyone at the workplace was being held accountable. It was his job to make sure that everyone was feeling heard. He sat at his desk and breezed over hundreds of handwritten notes until one caught his eye, “When they complain about work it was not because they wanted change, but because they needed emotional release” – Elton Mayo. He rubbed his thumb over the penned words. As much as I admire your wisdom Elton, I think these workers are starting to actually mean it…</p>
<p>Patrick looked away from his notebook and refreshed his inbox in hope that he would find a slew of new employee applications, but there was nothing. He checked the clock. Five minutes until John arrived. He heaved a sigh, why can’t he just follow the rules?</p>
<p>John Jenkins was on his way to work and set to be three minutes late. He was raced across the Hennepin Bridge with his head tilted slightly to the right to shelter his face from the Mississippi River’s cold breath. His long sandy brown hair rode the wind around his cheek and over his mouth and eyes making it hard to see. He cursed his thoughts knowing that once he arrived to work and freed himself of winter’s bite, he would be forced to defend himself again. </p>
<p>John was continually aghast at his manager, Patrick’s, belief in the corporate system. Everything was by the books with Patrick. You must follow this list exactly this way. And then you must log that information not just here but there as well. And you may never wear this or speak to a person like that. And you may never accept any type of food or drink from any resident or do anything that might make people believe we favor someone over another and… Patrick’s particulars seemingly went on for forever because he truly believed it was his position that made people choose to live at the Nord Haus. While on the contrary John couldn’t help but believe that a lobby man was no more than a paid dunce, a standing drumstick glazed in a neutral sauce, producing a smile that was manufactured for the rich and blind to the poor.  </p>
<p>John had been at the Nord Haus for only four months, but he had already endured several, as Patrick would call them, “On Clock Malfeasances.” Some of the infractions, John admitted as a former property manager himself, were completely reasonable; like the time that he decided to leave work early because three women who lived in the building asked him with pouty eyes and rouged cheeks to escort them to a party. There was also a time when he was accused of smelling like weed after his lunch break, but aside from those two, John felt most of the emails, write ups, and sit downs with Patrick had little to do with things that mattered at all. A great example was when he forgot to check the shared concierge email account. Another was for the time he wore his red winter hat from 2:00-4:30 am as he monitored a destitute lobby. </p>
<p>And so, as John trudged over the bridge and through the first neighborhood of Minneapolis’s new Northeast, he fretted that another one of Patrick’s sit downs loomed. Yesterday he had chosen to ignore Patrick’s email about him sitting in the swinging chairs for the final 15 minutes of his shift. </p>
<p>John arrived at the building and paused before entering. He stomped the snow out of his black dress shoes, and he situated his mask. He drew in one last deep breath in hopes of thawing out his cold thoughts of Patrick. I won’t call Patrick a friendless twat. Or bring up the fact that he doesn’t own the building even though he thinks he does, or that his rules are garbage, or that I know he can’t even fire me because we are already short staffed or that no one should even be working during a fucking global pandemic or… but the deep breath didn’t help.</p>
<p>Patrick watched John swing open the door and felt the cold run up his pants causing him to shiver and sigh as he thought about his own walk home. John took two steps toward Patrick with his eyes diverted away before looking to find his boss. “Afternoon Patrick,” John said flatly as he walked to the right and around the long end of the desk, “Can I get the shift keys so I can set my jacket down and we can talk?”</p>
<p>“Sure thing,” said Patrick, wishing he had gotten in the first word. He handed John the keys.
“How is it out there?” </p>
<p>“Really cold.” John replied like his answer. He snatched the keys from Patrick and headed around the corner toward the coat room. Patrick sat upright in his chair as John walked away and tried to find the posture that best hid his belly. He flattened his plaid shirt as a pang of insecurity rushed into his ears. He thought about how he had recently started buying his shirts one size bigger. He heard the door to the coat room close and he thought about Mayo’s quote, give him space to vent but remain strong. We have been here before.</p>
<p>As John set his coat down, he decided he would keep his covid mask on for the conversation. He made his way back to the desk and found himself a seat on the swivel chair to the left of Patrick.
“Sorry I didn’t respond to that email about me sitting in the swinging chairs.” John said staring directly into Patrick’s eyes. He furrowed his brow and squinted slightly hoping that Patrick would just say thanks for admitting to it and move on.
“So, you are acknowledging you saw my email and you actively ignored it?” Patrick pined.</p>
<p>John tried hard not to roll his eyes, but his eyeballs ended up looking as far to the left as they could while he breathed in.
“Yes, that is what I am saying.” </p>
<p>“And can you explain to me how you could you think you didn’t need to respond to that type of email?”
John closed his eyes. He bit his lip under his mask, and he started to count breaths like he had learned to do in one of his therapy sessions. His started cycling through all the sacrifices he had made to work under Patrick. He thought about the 5-week-bout with covid he had after those assholes from the 11th floor had a 30-person party bus right before Thanksgiving. He thought about how he had to cut six inches of his hair off for this job and how he’d been keeping his beard trimmed and his neck shaved. And then he thought about how he had to wear these dumb dress pants, and these horrible shoes that didn’t make any sense for Minnesota winters. And then he thought about all the compliments he had garnered on the Nord Haus community board that praised his cheerful nature and good service. And how Patrick never got any of those compliments. And how the leasing team loved him and then he thought about how that he had promised himself back when his valet company crashed at the beginning of this pandemic that he would never suck up to a rich shmuck for money again and yet here he was every weekend getting yelled at by some rich trust-fund kid who lives on the 10th floor and claims they are having financial hardships but pays for an apartment that is five thousand dollars a month. And somewhere in the middle of these thoughts John started breathing through his nose and then he opened his eyes and looked directly at Patrick’s lazy one and said, “I didn’t respond to your email because your email was fucking curt” And then he dropped back into his chair.</p>
<p>Patrick, who was mask-less, sat stunned at John’s accusation. While John, watched Patrick’s forty-something year old blue eyes fill with tears. 
Patrick harshly swallowed the lump in his throat down and brushed the top of his thighs twice before leaning back towards John and whispering the only thing he could think to say, which was, “I can’t believe you would be reading my emails with intentionality.” He stood up, and grabbed the keys to the coat room and walked away with as much dignity as he could muster. </p>
<p>John rolled his chair over to Patrick’s spot and started to log in to the computer. He spun around and reached into the cabinet behind the desk for one of the shift checklists that Patrick had created for the employees to follow. He began to review the first couple duties on the list:
3:00pm-3:05 PM: Clock in and then log on to computer and check all email accounts and community board messages. Respond to anything pertinent. If need be, situate the desk chair and computer monitors to your own convenience.
3:05pm-3:10pm: Scan lobby and decide whether anything needs cleaning. Go around and fluff all lobby pillows for desired appeal.</p>
<p>In the coat room, Patrick dried his eyes and reminded himself about how easy he made things for everyone. And how he knew that the order of this place was due in part to his diligence and dedication to good service. He knew that despite John’s egregious venom, he must continue to maintain a welcoming and accepting culture. He zipped his jacket and walked out of the coat room hoping to summon the power of the lobby’s wires. 
When he got back to the desk, he was about to drop the keys in front of John and leave without saying another word when John looked up him and lowered his mask. “Patrick, I’m sorry,” John started, “I was just mad at myself for screwing up such an easy rule. I knew better than to sit on those swings and I was even more wrong to call your email “curt” I know how much it means for you to have everyone on the team on the same page. So, that’s what that was all about....”</p>
<p>Standing over John, Patrick first looked up toward then ceiling, then over to the wires and then his eyes found their way back down towards John as he composed himself, “Thank you, John,” he said as matter of fact as he could, “I appreciate you saying that.” And then he plunged his hands in his coat pockets and started on his own mile long walk-through Minnesota’s cold.</p>
<p>John let almost twenty minutes pass before he looked back down at his shift checklist:
3:30pm – 3:45pm: Take shift keys and walk around the property to inspect for any suspicious activity. Make sure to straighten up the community rooms and the bike lounges. Be sure to fluff pillows if need be. </p>
<p>John reached under the desk for the hook where the shift keys should have been but felt nothing there. He paused before looking in the top right drawer where they were sometimes misplaced, and then checked around the corner to see if they had been left in the coat room door but again found nothing. “Fuck” he muttered. He took a deep breath and pulled out his phone and started to text Patrick: “Hey Patrick, I was looking for the shift keys and was thinking you might have accidently taken them with you?” John decided to add the chattering teeth emoji to imply nervousness. A minute later Patrick replied: “yeah I have them I will make my way back.” </p>
<p>John read Patrick’s text and grimaced. He looked back down at his phone and for some reason felt compelled to type: “I’m sorry Patrick” And then John just sat for a minute watching the cursor blink as he realized that he had to quit his job. He couldn’t and wouldn’t ever care about Patrick’s rules, and that wasn’t fair to Patrick, who was never going to stop believing that what he was doing was important. Something had to give.
John looked back down at his phone. </p>
<p>I’m so sorry that you have to be the manager. </p>

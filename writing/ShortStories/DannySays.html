        <h1>Danny Says</h1>
      

<main>
    <p>Danny used to play piano downtown, but he can’t anymore. Danny’s main job is stripping precious metals – shit like aluminum siding – so his hand is swollen and fucked up from that business, but that ain’t the main reason why he don’t play anymore...</p>
<p>When I met Danny, he was down at Merwin’s Wharf, looking over the guard rail of the river. His chin all jutted out, arms back, wearing a stained trench coat and gas station sunglasses. When I approached, he told me he was busy being a figurehead, that he was envisioning life as a boat. I told him I had a little something in my pocket that would make him faster than a boat, and he said, let’s go back to my place, which, I was surprised he had a place. We hopped on the Metro and made it three stops before a transit officer noticed him and said, “Not today, Danny”, so we had to get off and hoof it the rest of the way.</p>
<p>He was squatting at a development project owned by Antonio Barbiere, like those Barbiere’s. Antonio is the youngest son, nicknamed “The Landlord”, and he must own 100 properties. He’s got city officials in his pocket, knows Jimmy Dimora, all of that. So, I was like, “Danny, you sure we should be here?”, but Danny told me it was cool because he went way back with Antonio. Said they went to boarding school together and that he was going to see him later today. </p>
<p>I said, “How do you figure?”, and he said he saw it in a dream. In the dream, he gets led into an office by a guy named Slim, Antonio’s there, and then they play blackjack, and Danny says it ends after he wins back his dead sister’s stuffed doll, Dolly. Added getting Dolly back would finally give his mother something to be proud of. </p>
<p>Well, not five minutes later a car pulls up and this huge fucker steps out in a leather jacket. He’s bald, dark sunglasses, walking like he’s got a gun. He comes right through the door, no knock or nothing. Danny says, “Slim?” and this guy says, “Come with me.” And I’m sitting there all high and paranoid like no fucking way. </p>
<p>In the next part, we just gotta take Danny’s word, but I believe him. I’ve seen Danny play the piano, and he’s really good – like can play anything good – so that’s one reason it’s so sad his hand is gone, but also, I know for a fact that Danny is a math whiz. You can quiz him with some crazy shit, like, what’s 66 X 71 and he nails it every time. He says back at boarding school, he beat out Barbiere for a Math scholarship, and that Antonio got so mad he snuck into Danny’s room while Danny was at orchestra and stole Dolly. When Danny found out, he saw red and beat Antonio’s face so bad that Danny got expelled, which I guess is when he and his mom started falling out. I bet Danny did something else too, just knowing Danny…</p>
<p>Anyway, Slim escorts him to this office. He said Antonio was sitting behind a big desk. Versace button up shirt. Fat face, mustache, curly hair, smoking, sweating. He had Dolly all propped up on the desk, and then said, “Long time, Danny. I heard you’ve been staying at one of my developments.”</p>
<p>Danny said Antonio was trying to act intimidating, which he is given his various nefarious activities outside of landlording. But Danny says he had a plan. Says he looked Antonio right in his eyeballs and said, “Let’s play Blackjack. If I beat you three straight hands, I get to keep the house.”</p>
<p>Barbiere can’t say no to gambling. Orders Slim to fetch his deck, and they start playing. Danny counts cards, so he lets Antonio win the first hand and then starts taking him. Antonio was fuming, and Danny says that’s when his vision went all crazy – like light-sensitive migraine crazy – says that Antonio became bordered by these shining fractals, and that it seemed heavenly, and that’s when he heard the voice in his ear. Danny said the voice was so pure it raised all the hair on his body, made his nipples hard, the whole works. 
“Seven of Hearts” is what the voice told him. </p>
<p>Dannys says he looked at Antonio and said, “Pick a card, Antonio, and if I guess right, I get to take Dolly home.” </p>
<p>Barbiere smirks. He didn’t care about the doll, but he wanted Danny to feel pain. He shuffled the deck. “What’s the card, Danny?”</p>
<p>You already know the answer: Seven of fucking hearts. Crazy shit, man. </p>
<p>So, I guess, Antonio started losing it. Ordered Slim to search him. Slim searched him, but Danny ain’t got nothing on him. Antonio started laughing, then he gets pissed, claims Danny rigged the deck, remembered it was his deck, ordered Slim to search him again and finally threw the doll on the ground and told him to get lost.</p>
<p>Unreal, right?</p>
<p>But I guess a week later, someone showed up and cut Danny’s hand off. So that’s why he can’t play piano anymore, but Danny doesn’t seem to mind. He’s just happy he got Dolly back. 
So, if you’re looking for him, last I saw, he’s still hanging down by the wharf, doing his whole figurehead thing. Wearing that trench coat, except now Dolly peeks out the pocket. He was cracking me up because he was wearing a plastic bag filled with deli ham and apples around his head like a headband. Told me it was a three-part method: 1) it was keeping his hand free, 2) it was keeping his posture upright, which 3) helped his hernia.</p>
<p>So yeah, he’s doing all right as far as I can tell. The only bummer is it sounds like his mom still won’t see him, but hey, the beat goes on, man, the beat goes on. </p>
